# MLDCAT-AP Validator
**Usage note:**
Please be informed that the MLDCAT-AP validator is now being redirected to the [SEMIC SHACL Validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/semic-shacl/upload). 
The domain-aliases set in place will redirect the current validator ensuring that this change does not affect your existing setups for the MLDCAT-AP validator.

In case any issues arise, kindly flag them in the [SEMIC SHACL Validator repository](https://github.com/SEMICeu/semic-shacl-validator/issues).

The files you may edit to adapt the validation are as follows:
* Folder `resources\v2.2.1` contains the files for version 2.2.1.
* File `resources\config.properties` contains configuration that you may want to adapt.

To publish changes commit and push your updates. In 1-2 minutes the online service will be updated.

The online service is accessible as follows:
* REST API: https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/swagger-ui.html (use 'mldcat-ap' as the domain value in requests).
